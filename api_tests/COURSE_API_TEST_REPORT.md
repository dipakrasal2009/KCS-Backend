- Course Operations: ~100-200ms
- Content Operations: ~100-300ms
- Enhanced Features: ~100-200ms

## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### 🔴 Critical Issues:
1. **Course Content Schema Mismatch**
   - Expected: `content_title`, `content_description`, `sort_order`
   - Actual: `title`, `content`, `order`
   - Impact: Content creation fails with documented payload

2. **Course Enrollment Schema Mismatch**
   - Missing required fields: `status`, `progress` in enrollmentData
   - Impact: Enrollment creation fails

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues:
1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Students can create/update courses (should be restricted)
   - Need to implement proper RBAC for course management

2. **Assignment Creation**
   - Requires `subject_id` field not mentioned in test
   - Need complete assignment creation schema

### 🟢 Minor Issues:
1. **Documentation Alignment**
   - Some API schemas in code don't match documentation
   - Need to sync documentation with actual implementation

## 🎯 Recommendations

### 📝 Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix Schema Mismatches:**
   ```javascript
   // Update content creation to use documented schema
   POST /api/course/{id}/content
   {
     "content_title": "...",  // Not "title"
     "content_description": "...", // Not "content"  
     "sort_order": 1 // Not "order"
   }
   ```

2. **Implement RBAC:**
   - Restrict course creation to Admin/Teacher roles only
   - Add middleware to validate user permissions

3. **Update Documentation:**
   - Sync API documentation with actual implementation
   - Add missing required fields to schemas

### 🚀 Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **Add Missing DELETE Operations:**
   - Course deletion testing
   - Content deletion testing
   - Enrollment deletion testing

2. **Improve Error Messages:**
   - More descriptive validation errors
   - Better error codes and messages

3. **Add Pagination Testing:**
   - Test large dataset handling
   - Verify pagination parameters
