# Teacher Service Enhancement: User Meta Data Integration

## Overview
Enhanced the TeacherService to automatically manage the `teacher_id` in the user's `meta_data` when teachers are created or deleted.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `createTeacher` Method
- **Feature**: Automatically appends the new teacher ID to the user's `meta_data` when a teacher is created
- **Process**:
  1. Create the teacher record
  2. Retrieve the associated user
  3. Parse existing `meta_data` (handles both string and object formats)
  4. Add `teacher_id` to the `meta_data`
  5. Update the user record with the enhanced `meta_data`

### 2. Enhanced `deleteTeacher` Method
- **Feature**: Automatically removes the `teacher_id` from the user's `meta_data` when a teacher is deleted
- **Process**:
  1. Retrieve the teacher record to get the `user_id`
  2. Retrieve the associated user
  3. Parse existing `meta_data`
  4. Remove `teacher_id` from the `meta_data`
  5. Update the user record
  6. Delete the teacher record

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
```
Teacher Creation:
User Record + Teacher Creation → User.meta_data.teacher_id = teacher.id

Teacher Deletion:
User.meta_data.teacher_id = undefined ← Teacher Deletion + User Update
```

### Error Handling
- Both operations include comprehensive error handling
- Meta data updates are non-blocking (teacher operations succeed even if meta data update fails)
- Errors are logged for debugging purposes
- Graceful handling of malformed JSON in meta_data

### Meta Data Handling
- Supports both string (JSON) and object formats for `meta_data`
- Safely parses JSON strings with fallback to empty object
- Uses TypeScript casting to work with the validation schema transformation

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: Maintains bidirectional relationship between users and teachers
2. **Performance**: Enables faster lookups by having teacher_id directly in user meta_data
3. **Reliability**: Non-blocking updates ensure core teacher operations always succeed
4. **Flexibility**: Handles various meta_data formats gracefully

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Teacher
```typescript
const teacher = await TeacherService.createTeacher(campusId, {
    user_id: "user-123",
    subjects: [],
    classes: []
});
// User's meta_data will now contain: { ..., teacher_id: "teacher-456" }
```

### Deleting a Teacher
```typescript
await TeacherService.deleteTeacher("teacher-456");
// User's meta_data will have teacher_id removed
```

## Testing Considerations

When testing teacher creation/deletion:
- Verify that `user.meta_data.teacher_id` is properly set after teacher creation
- Verify that `user.meta_data.teacher_id` is properly removed after teacher deletion
- Test with existing meta_data (both string and object formats)
- Test error scenarios where user update fails but teacher operation succeeds
