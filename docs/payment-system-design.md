## System Overview

### Vision
Create a white-label payment system that allows schools to collect fees directly into their bank accounts through multiple payment gateways, with the SaaS platform providing the infrastructure without taking any transaction fees.

### Key Principles
- **School Autonomy**: Each school maintains complete control over their finances
- **Zero SaaS Charges**: Platform doesn't charge any fees on transactions
- **Multi-Gateway Support**: Support for 3+ payment gateways for redundancy
- **Flexible Fee Structure**: Support different fee types and structures per school
- **Transparent Operations**: Clear audit trails and reporting for all stakeholders

## User Workflow & Interactions

### 1. School Admin Setup Workflow

#### Initial Setup (One-time)
1. **Login to Admin Panel**
   - School admin logs into the SaaS platform
   - Navigates to "Payment Configuration" section

- **Use Case**: Alternative for specific regions
- **Payment Methods**: Cards, UPI, Net Banking
- **Features**: Risk management, Easy integration
- **Configuration**:
  ```typescript
  {
    gateway_name: "payu",
    config: {
      merchant_key: "...",
      merchant_salt: "...",
      auth_header: "...",
      base_url: "..."
    }
  }
  ```

### Payment Flow

#### Standard Payment Flow
1. **Initiation**: Student selects fees and payment method
2. **Gateway Selection**: System selects optimal gateway based on:
   - School preferences
   - Payment method availability
   - Gateway health status
   - Transaction success rates
3. **Payment Processing**: Redirect to gateway or embed payment form
4. **Verification**: Webhook + API verification for security
5. **Settlement**: Direct settlement to school's bank account
6. **Notification**: Real-time updates to all stakeholders

#### Fallback Mechanism
- Primary gateway failure → Secondary gateway
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Manual gateway switching for admins
