# Course API - Executive Summary

## Overview

The KCS Learning Management System's Course API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing online courses, content delivery, and student enrollment. The API follows RESTful principles and implements role-based access control to ensure appropriate permissions across different user types.

## Key Components

### 1. Course Management
- **Primary Endpoint**: `/api/course/`
- **Functionality**: Full CRUD operations for course creation, reading, updating, and deletion
- **Access Control**: Primarily admin-level access for management operations
- **Data Structure**: Courses contain metadata like credits, duration, difficulty level, and instructor information

### 2. Course Content Management
- **Primary Endpoint**: `/api/course/{course_id}/content/`
- **Functionality**: Manage learning materials, lessons, videos, documents, and interactive content
- **Content Types**: Lessons, quizzes, assignments, resources, assessments, interactive materials
- **Content Formats**: Text, video, audio, documents, presentations, interactive media
- **Access Control**: Teachers and admins can create/modify content; students can view enrolled course content

### 3. Course Enrollment System
- **Primary Endpoint**: `/api/course/{course_id}/enrollment/`
- **Functionality**: Handle student enrollments, progress tracking, and grading
- **Features**: Enrollment dates, completion tracking, grade management, progress monitoring
- **Access Control**: Students can enroll themselves; teachers/admins manage enrollments

### 4. Related Systems
- **Assignments**: Managed via separate `/api/assignments/` endpoint
- **Enhanced Content**: Advanced features via `/api/course-content/` endpoint
- **Analytics**: Built-in progress and performance tracking

## User Role Capabilities

| Role | Course Management | Content Creation | Enrollment Management | Content Access |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Student** | View only | ❌ | Self-enroll only | Enrolled courses only |
| **Teacher** | View only | ✅ Full access | View & grade | All course content |
| **Staff** | View only | ❌ | View only | Limited access |
| **Principal** | View only | ❌ | Full management | All content |
| **Admin** | ✅ Full CRUD | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full management | ✅ All access |
| **Super Admin** | ✅ Cross-campus | ✅ System-wide | ✅ Global management | ✅ Universal access |

## API Architecture Highlights

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control implemented via middleware
- Campus-scoped operations (users can only access their campus data)

### Data Models
- **Course Model**: Core course information with flexible metadata
- **Course Content Model**: Rich content structure supporting multiple formats
- **Course Enrollment Model**: Comprehensive enrollment tracking with grading
- **Assignment Models**: Separate system for assignment management
- **Submission Models**: Track student assignment submissions

### Response Patterns
- Consistent JSON response format
- Standardized error handling (401, 500 error codes)
- RESTful HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation

## Business Logic Flow

### Course Creation Workflow
1. Admin creates course with basic information
2. Teacher/Admin adds course content (lessons, materials)
3. Content is organized with sorting and access controls
4. Course is published and made available for enrollment

### Student Learning Journey
1. Student browses available courses
2. Enrolls in desired courses
3. Accesses course content in structured sequence
4. Completes assignments and activities
5. Receives grades and feedback
6. Progress is tracked automatically

### Content Management Workflow
1. Content creators upload materials
2. Content is categorized by type and format
3. Access permissions and prerequisites are set
4. Content is sequenced using sort_order
5. Students access content based on enrollment and permissions

## Technical Features

### Content Management Capabilities
- **Multi-format Support**: Text, video, audio, documents, presentations, interactive content
- **Access Controls**: Free, premium, and restricted access levels
- **Prerequisites**: Content dependencies and learning paths
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion requirements and time estimation
- **Interaction Features**: Comments, notes, bookmarks support

### Enrollment Features
- **Flexible Enrollment**: Date-based enrollment periods
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Grading System**: Assignment-level and overall course grading
- **Completion Tracking**: Automatic completion detection
- **Custom Metadata**: Extensible enrollment data

### Analytics & Reporting
- Course performance metrics
- Student progress tracking
- Completion rates and analytics
- Grade distribution analysis

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- **Assignment System**: Separate assignment management via `/api/assignments/`
- **Enhanced Content**: Advanced content features via `/api/course-content/`
- **Authentication**: Centralized JWT-based auth system
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible storage for media content
- **Notification System**: Course-related notifications

### Database Integration
- Ottoman ODM (Object Document Mapper) for Couchbase
- Indexed queries for performance optimization
- Campus-based data segregation
- Flexible schema with metadata support

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability Features
- Campus-based data isolation
- Indexed database queries
- Efficient content delivery
- Role-based data filtering

### Caching Strategy
