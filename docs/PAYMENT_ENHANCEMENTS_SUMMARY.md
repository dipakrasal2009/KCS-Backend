## 🔒 Security & Campus Isolation

All new features maintain the existing security model:

- **Campus Isolation**: Every operation is scoped to `campus_id`
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper authorization checks for all endpoints
- **Admin-Only Operations**: Sensitive operations restricted to admin users
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Audit Trails**: All operations are logged with user and timestamp information

## 📱 Integration Points

### With Existing Payment System:
- Seamless integration with existing fee models
- Compatible with all payment gateways (Razorpay, PayU, Cashfree)
- Works with existing invoice generation
- Maintains existing payment flows

### Database Structure:
- New models follow existing Ottoman.js patterns
- Proper indexing for performance
- Campus-based data segregation
- Referential integrity maintained

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Setting Up Automatic Notifications:
```javascript
// Schedule daily reminders
await PaymentNotificationService.schedulePaymentReminders(campus_id);

// Send bulk overdue notifications
const result = await PaymentNotificationService.sendBulkPaymentReminders(campus_id);
console.log(`Sent ${result.sent} reminders, ${result.failed} failed`);
```

### 2. Creating Discount Rules:
```javascript
// Create early bird discount
const discountRule = await DiscountService.createDiscountRule(campus_id, {
  name: "Early Bird 15% Off",
  discount_type: "percentage",
  discount_value: 15,
  conditions: {
    early_payment_days: 30,
    applicable_fee_categories: ["tuition"]
  },
  auto_apply: true
}, admin_user_id);
```

### 3. Bulk Fee Generation:
```javascript
// Generate fees for entire grade
const bulkResult = await BulkOperationsService.generateBulkFees(campus_id, {
  template_id: "grade_10_monthly",
  academic_year: "2023-24",
  class_ids: ["grade_10_a", "grade_10_b"],
  apply_discounts: true,
  send_notifications: true
}, admin_user_id);
```

### 4. Analytics Dashboard:
```javascript
// Get comprehensive analytics
const analytics = await PaymentAnalyticsService.getPaymentAnalytics(campus_id, {
  start_date: new Date('2023-01-01'),
  end_date: new Date('2023-12-31')
});

// Generate monthly report
const report = await PaymentAnalyticsService.generatePaymentReport(
  campus_id, 
  "monthly"
);
```
