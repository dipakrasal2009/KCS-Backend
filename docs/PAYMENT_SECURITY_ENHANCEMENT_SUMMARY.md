  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  try {
    await next();
  } catch (error) {
    const executionTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    const errorResponse = handlePaymentError(error, ctx, executionTime);
    return ctx.json(errorResponse.body, errorResponse.status);
  }
};
```

### 4. Enhanced Payment Service (`payment.service.ts`)
**Status: âœ… ENHANCED - Upgraded core payment operations**

### 5. Enhanced Payment Controller (`payment.controller.ts`)
**Status: âœ… ENHANCED - Improved error handling and new endpoints**

#### Enhanced Methods:
- Updated imports to include new monitoring services
- `initiatePayment()` - Enhanced error responses
- `verifyPayment()` - Improved error handling

#### New Security Endpoints:
- `GET /payments/security/dashboard` - Comprehensive security dashboard
- `GET /payments/security/events/:event_id` - Detailed event information

#### Security Dashboard Features:
```json
{
  "security_metrics": {
    "total_events": 1542,
    "critical_events": 3,
    "failed_authentications": 12,
    "successful_payments": 1420,
